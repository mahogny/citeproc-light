AB  - This dataset includes information on sea stars collected during the ANDEEP3
      expedition, which took place in 2005. The expedition focused on deep-sea stations
      in the Powell Basin and Weddell Sea.Sea stars were collected using an Agassiz
      trawl (3m, mesh-size 500microm), deployed in 16 stations during the ANTXXII/3
      (ANDEEP3, PS72) expedition of the RV Polarstern. Sampling depth ranged from 1047 
      to 4931m. Trawling distance ranged from 731 to 3841m. The sampling area ranges
      from -41 degrees S to -71 degrees S (latitude) and from 0 to -65 degrees W
      (longitude). A complete list of stations is available from the PANGAEA data
      system (http://www.pangaea.de/PHP/CruiseReports.php?b=Polarstern), including a
      cruise report (http://epic-reports.awi.de/3694/1/PE_72.pdf).The dataset includes 
      50 records, with individual counts ranging from 1-10, reaching a total of 132
      specimens.The andeep3-Asteroidea is a unique dataset as it covers an
      under-explored region of the Southern Ocean, and that very little information was
      available regarding Antarctic deep-sea starfish. Before this study, most of the
      information available focused on starfish from shallower depths than 1000m. This 
      dataset allowed to make unique observations, such as the fact that some species
      were only present at very high depths (Hymenaster crucifer, Hymenaster
      pellucidus, Hymenaster praecoquis, Psilaster charcoti, Freyella attenuata,
      Freyastera tuberculata, Styrachaster chuni and Vemaster sudatlanticus were all
      found below -3770m), while others displayed remarkable eurybathy, with very high 
      depths amplitudes (Bathybiaster loripes (4842m), Lysasterias adeliae (4832m),
      Lophaster stellans (4752m), Cheiraster planeta (4708m), Eremicaster crassus
      (4626m), Lophaster gaini (4560m) and Ctenodiscus australis (4489m)).Even if the
      number of records is relatively small, the data bring many new insights on the
      taxonomic, bathymetric and geographic distributions of Southern starfish,
      covering a very large sampling zone. The dataset also brings to light six
      species, newly reported in the Southern Ocean.The quality of the data was
      controlled very thoroughly, by means of on-board Polarstern GPS systems, checking
      of identification by a renowned specialist (Prof. Michel Jangoux, Universite
      Libre de Bruxelles), and matching to the Register of Antarctic Marine Species
      (RAMS) and World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). The data is therefore fit
      for completing checklists, for inclusion in biodiversity patterns analysis, or
      niche modeling. It also nicely fills an information gap regarding deep-sea
      starfish from the Southern Ocean, for which data is very scarce at this time. The
      authors may be contacted if any additional information is needed before carrying 
      out detailed biodiversity or biogeographic studies.
